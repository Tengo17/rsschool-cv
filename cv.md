## About myself 
Currently I work at JSC Aerostructure Technologies Cyclone, as a Production Engineer.  Previously I occupied the position of a CMM programmer in the same company, which is when I first developed my interest in information technologies.

In my search for next steps towards professional evolution, I have found Front-End Development to be the most interesting and promising field.  To pursue this interest I took a front-end development course at  Smart Academy, which has honed my CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript skills, as well as my knowledge of mobile and responsive design. I have further completed number of online courses and have acquired corresponding certificates in various specific areas concerning front-end development.


 I am exceptionally driven, detail oriented, eager to acquire knowledge and develop new skills. With my prior coding experience and the knowledge that I have acquired at Smart Academy, I believe I have strong foundation to transition into the world of Front-End Development and progress even further.

## Code examples

```JavaScript
function convertToRoman(num) {
    if (isNaN(num))
        return NaN;
    var digits = String(+num).split(""),
        key = ["","C","CC","CCC","CD","D","DC","DCC","DCCC","CM",
               "","X","XX","XXX","XL","L","LX","LXX","LXXX","XC",
               "","I","II","III","IV","V","VI","VII","VIII","IX"],
        roman = "",
        i = 3;
    while (i--)
        roman = (key[+digits.pop() + (i * 10)] || "") + roman;
    return Array(+digits.join("") + 1).join("M") + roman;
}

console.log(convertToRoman(36));
```
## Work experience
#### As a CMM programmer,  my responsibilities included following:
* Determine program requirements based on design and engineering requirements.
* Ensure that precision machinery is in working condition and properly calibrated.
* Operate precision machinery as needed.
* Write or edit programs for precision machinery.

In my capacity as a Production Engineer I have created a program (python project) that processes data from Autoclave Machine runs and analyses the output in accordance with Boeing standards. (The project is available for inspection on GitHub)

I have acquired additional coding experience while interviewing for various front-end developer positions at tech companies.
I have two front-end projects completed at a request of such companies during interviewing process, and eight more as a part of an online course. (All are available for inspection on GitHub)
